# Acknowledgements

To positionate each node of the tree on 2D plane in an aesthetically pleasing way, I implemented the Reingold-Tilford's algorithm. Thanks to [this](https://llimllib.github.io/pymag-trees/#foot5) helpful webpage and [this](http://dirk.jivas.de/papers/buchheim02improving.pdf) amazing paper.
